NOVA Project Overview: Oliver Thorpe (Database Validation Engineer / Quality Assurance Tester)

Role Summary
As Database Validation Engineer and QA Tester, I focus on checking that the database behaves correctly and supports the required use cases.

Validation Objectives
- Confirm that foreign key relationships between users, orders, and order_items work as expected.
- Ensure products in the catalogue can be retrieved and displayed correctly on the products_dashboard and product_details pages.
- Verify that order totals are stored accurately.

Planned Test Activities
- Create a small set of sample users, products, and orders for testing.
- Run SELECT queries that join users with their orders and order_items.
- Check that deleting a user or product does not break referential integrity (e.g. via cascading rules or restrictions).

QA Notes
- Document any data issues found and report them to Malaika for schema updates.
- Support back-end developers by confirming that test data reflects real-world scenarios described in Section 5.
